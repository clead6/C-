# Console Tetris

## TL;DR
This is a simple Tetris game that I made in third semester. 

### How to use this?

#### Visual Studio
The entire code is in a Visual Studio project format. You can simply open the project using Visual Studio and hit RUN.

#### G++
- Navigate to the ```main.cpp``` file and open terminal.
- Type ```g++ main.cpp``` and the application will run.

### Requirements
- Visual Studio for convenience.
- A C++ compiler.
- Windows OS (does not work with Linux).

### What's next?
Nothing really. Use this code however you like :)
